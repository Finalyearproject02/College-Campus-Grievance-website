About This Project
The purpose of the Online Grievance System For Colleges and other educational institutes is to better automation in focus. The grievances System cell deals with all types of grievances, complaints, and malpractices including those received from Students, Faculty, and other Stakeholders. This website provides a helping hand to students and staff by acknowledging and solving their problems. It maintains a healthy environment for the stakeholders of the institute. Institutes need to exercise prudence in such important matters. We understand your institute’s need to be fair in complaints handling processes. This eventually leads to students’ dissatisfaction. Hence, to maintain the dignity of the college or institute by ensuring a conflict-free atmosphere by promoting good student-teacher relationships we have developed a Student Grievance System that will address the students’ issues & grievances. With project:- Report, PPT Class Diagram, Setup Your Device, All Doubts are Clear, Viva Questions, Etc.
